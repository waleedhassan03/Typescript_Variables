// Var variable in typescript

// it os recommended to use "let" and "cosnt" variables over "var" varibale because its a drawback in var that we can write same name to different varaibles and it will create confusion in the code.

// By using var 
var employeeName = "Hassan";
console.log(employeeName);
                                  
var employeeName = "Ali";
console.log(employeeName); 

//here we have assigned same name in both the examples and it will create confusion
